## Deeplearning_Homework with python3.6
.py version of Deep Learning homework for pure enjoyment.

There are some bugs in origin version of answer beacause of  VERSION change in different module.

If this repository violate deeplearn.ai 's copy right, please email me.

Uncomment code for runing test case. If you can not run successfully, please check out your module's version:
